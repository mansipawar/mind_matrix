#Motive: Create an effective system for detecting mental illness.

Module 1: Design an easy-to-use Questionnaire module for self-assessment.
Module 2: Use CNN to analyse emotional states with Facial Emotion Detection. 
Module 3: Incorporate Socio-emotional Detection to discover anomalies in social and emotional behaviour.
Module 4: Create a responsive and informative BOT Assistant to provide timely assistance and resources.


#1. Project Overview:

Our project aims to assess mental health through a questionnaire.
Implemented as a web application using Flask for the backend and HTML/JavaScript for the frontend.

Facial Emotion Detection using CNN:
CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) approaches for facial emotion identification use deep learning
models to automatically identify and categorize human emotions from facial expressions in pictures or video
frames.
