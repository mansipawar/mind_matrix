# 1. Project Overview:

Our project aims to assess mental health through a questionnaire.
Implemented as a web application using Flask for the backend and HTML/JavaScript for the frontend.

Facial Emotion Detection using CNN:
CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) approaches for facial emotion identification use deep learning
models to automatically identify and categorize human emotions from facial expressions in pictures or video
frames.
